							"description": "<p class=\"p1\">In Commonlands, you may encounter two types of disputes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here's what they mean and their implications:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ownership Disputes</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ownership disputes arise when two or more individuals stake a claim on the same piece of land, and they don't recognize each other's claims, implying they don't link their plots together. In this case, each party needs to create their own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://commonlands.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14542584607255\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">Claimchain</span></a>&nbsp;to qualify for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://commonlands.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14542623507863\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">Commonlands Certificate</span></a>. This type of dispute is considered more severe, as it directly questions the legitimacy of ownership.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Boundary Disputes</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Boundary disputes occur when neighbors recognize each other's presence (i.e., they've linked their plots) but can't agree on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://commonlands.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14542631790743\"><span class=\"s1\">precise demarcation of their shared boundary</span></a>. Since these neighbors acknowledge each other, this dispute doesn't disrupt a Claimchain, making it less severe. It's primarily about clarifying property lines rather than questioning ownership rights.</p>",
